### Who are you?

- @tkoyama010: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tkoyama010), [Booth](https://tkoyama010.booth.pm/)
- I have been developing civil engineering and architectural software and conducting contract analysis with a software vendor of the finite element method for about 8 years.(Fortran, Python, C++, VBScript etc)
- I'm a graduate of the Earthquake Engineering Department of Architecture.
 - [IMPROVEMENT OF CALCULATION PRECISION OF THEORETICAL GROUND MOTIONS USING THIN LAYER METHOD AND ITS VERIFICATION, PART 2](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/aijt/17/35/17_35_55/_article/-char/ja/)

### Who are you?

- Since last year, I have been distributing translated books of [GetFEM++](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/GetFEM%2B%2B) in the event technical book of [techbookfest](https://techbookfest.org/).
- üòùI'm a GetFEM + + committer, but I've been earning commits for odd jobs. (Fix types, refactoring, translation tasks, etc.)
- I have recently started to add objects because I understand the internal structure quite well.
  - lumped mass brick object
  - Houbolt method objects
- üò§[contributing status](https://github.com/tkoyama010/getfem/graphs/contributors) my first goal is 100 commits.
